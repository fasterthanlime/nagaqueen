leg grammar for ooc

it's intended to be pretty simple, a starting point
to be used in your next IDE/doc tool/refactoring tool/
syntax highlighting/cool ooc project, as it was
the starting point of rock, our brand new compiler.

nagaqueen is a work in progress, so if it doesn't
parse everything, don't sweat it, there should be
improvements every few hours.

and don't forget to have fun!
