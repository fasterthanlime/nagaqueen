nagaqueen: a leg grammar for ooc
================================

why a grammar?
--------------

  - for rock, our new compiler
  - for you to learn the language
  - for your next project to parse ooc easily

does it work?
-------------

nagaqueen is a work in progress, so if it doesn't
parse everything, don't sweat it, there should be
improvements every few hours.

what is leg?
------------

Ian Piumarta's peg/leg (v0.14+) is a modern parser generator
based on the PEG paper, it allows to define a grammar in a
simple and straight-forward way

get it while it's hot: http://piumarta.com/software/peg/

how to test it?
---------------

  - install peg/leg
  - run 'make test'
  - PROFIT!

don't be shy. open the grammar, modify it to see the effects.
it can't hurt, and is actually pretty simple to understand =)

have fun!
