nagaqueen: a greg grammar for ooc
=================================

why a grammar?
--------------

  - for rock, our new compiler
  - for you to learn the language
  - for your next project to parse ooc easily

does it work?
-------------

nagaqueen is a work in progress, so if it doesn't
parse everything, don't sweat it, there should be
improvements every few hours.

what is greg?
-------------

greg is _why's fork of Ian Piumarta's peg/leg, then forked
again by nddrylliog to fix a few bugs (since _why is gone)

it's a modern parser generator based on the PEG paper,
allowing to define a grammar in a simple and straight-forward way

get it while it's hot: http://github.com/nddrylliog/greg/

how to test it?
---------------

  - install greg
  - run 'make test'
  - PROFIT!

don't be shy. open the grammar, modify it to see the effects.
it can't hurt, and is actually pretty simple to understand =)

have fun!
